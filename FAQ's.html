            <button>
                <span>How does the virus spread?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p> COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. 
              The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza 
              but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.

                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p>The Government has set up national helpline numbers that are functional 24*7. In addition to this, the government
              has  also set up a dedicated WhatsApp group to spread awareness regarding the deadly coronavirus.  Also, the government
              is updating the latest information such as the number of people infected, deaths, etc. on its official website.

                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Yes. If you and your family have not been exposed to the virus, isolation will keep you protected. 
              And if you have been exposed and recommended self-quarantine, make sure you follow that dutifully to 
              keep other safe.</p>

              <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
          </button>
          <p>It is not completely safe to visit a hospital, more so if you are above the 
            age of 60 or suffering from comorbidities. However, if you have to visit the 
            hospital for screening, dialysis etc, inform your healthcare official beforehand
            and make sure you wear a mask and maintain safe distance from others.</p>

            <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
        </button>
        <p>The University is receiving a very limited supply of the vaccine.  
          At this time, we encourage you to seek vaccination from all sources: 
          state sites, pharmacies and your primary care physician.It is unknown when 
          l receive a larger supply from the state, and you should not plan for HUHS to 
          be your sole source for vaccination.

    <div class="question">
      <button>
          <span>How do I know if it is COVID-19 or just the common cold?</span>
          <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
      </button>
      <p>A COVID-19 infection has similar signs and symptoms as the common cold

        <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>

    <p> A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes,
      nose, or mouth.The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer 
      periods of time.

  <button>
      <span>How can I reduce stress down during the coronavirus <br> pandemic?</span>
      <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>

<div class="question">
  <button>
      <span>Are smokers more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19?</span>
      <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
  </button>
  <p>Tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19,
    as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility 
    of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth.</p>
